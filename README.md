## Password Generator

Simple webpage to generate random password

## Motivation


Created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by  JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Acceptance Criteria


GIVEN I need a new, secure password
    WHEN I click the button to generate a password
        THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
            WHEN prompted for password criteria
                THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
                    
                    WHEN prompted for the length of the password
                    THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters -- Done
                    
                    WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
                    THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

                    WHEN I answer each prompt
                    THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
                    
                    WHEN all prompts are answered
                    THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
                    WHEN the password is generated
                    THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
